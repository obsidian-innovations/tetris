Remember, that playing Tetris

 - Even reasonable 30 minutes per day for three months increases cerebral cortex thickness and 
 improves general cognitive functions defined as "critical thinking, reasoning, language and processing". 
 
 - Could positively influence people trying to diet, quit alcohol abuse or smoking 
 as per research by the Plymouth University's Cognition Institute.  
 
 - Can potentially reduce flashbacks for the people suffering posttraumatic stress disorder.
